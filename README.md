# Extended K치lm치n Filter for Neural Networks

This repo aims at the creation of a manual neural network, found at `def_ekf.py`, that uses the extended K치lm치n filter. In order to test such algorithm, I have applied it to a nonlinear system: the double pendulum, getting very interesting results: the EKF has been successfully implemented and was capable of capturing the trend of the physical system.
